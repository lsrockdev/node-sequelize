The varieties of potatoes include solist, gammel svensk röd, princess, sankta thora, hamlet, marine and celine. Each varietal is distilled only once through a continuous column still lined with copper. The varietals are then blended without charcoal filtration, which would remove valuable flavor elements. The resulting vodka is full-bodied and rich, with a distinct viscosity and mouth-feel that is unlike other vodkas on the market today. Although it is designed to be served neat, on the rocks or in a martini, also try Karlsson\u0027s Gold with fresh cracked black pepper or as a unique base for your favorite cocktail. ",

KSCW is the predecessor to bourbon whiskey, which has at least 51% corn in the mash bill. Only when the corn content is at least 80% can a whiskey be designated as corn whiskey. Authentic whiskey selection is a recognizable strength of Preiss Imports. The Hirsch Selection hand picked series of single barrel whiskies is chosen expressly for connoisseurs of small batch fine spirits. In tradition, we invite you to savor this classic KSCW, which has been specially aged and mellowed in reused oak barrels. This KSCW is another true original Hirsch Selection.",

First, grapes were hand-picked, de-stemmed and crushed prior to undergoing cool fermentation in steel tanks and an extended maceration. A small portion of the wine was made with the traditional passito method: we dried harvested grapes on straw mats for several weeks, then gently pressed and fermented them before blending.

Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. is credited with brewing one of the first widely available craft beers in America in 1979 with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Sierra Nevada Torpedo is a more aggressive and hopped up version of the popular Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Sierra Navada utilizes dry-hopping, which is very popular today among hop heads in the craft beer boom sweeping across the United States. Dry-hopping is a technique used by brewers adding whole cone hops to fermentation tanks. This process allows the oils and resins to add flavor and aroma to the beer without increasing bitterness.\r\n\r\nThis beer pours a clear yellow, with a small white head that doesn\u0027t recede immediately, and has medium carbonation. It smells of citrus, orange, resin and pine. Torpedo leads with orange and citrus, followed by a bitter bite with earthy pine on the back end.",

There is very little of the sweetness that is frequently to be tasted with doppelbock beer.”\r\n\r\n6.7% ABV",

Aged 8 years, the Five Stars rum, or \"Special Reserve\" is all in balance. It is excellent dry, but can be appreciated with ice cubes, decorated with a zest of lemon, to reveal all its subtleties.",

Vaccari named the spirit after Giuseppe Galliano, an Italian hero of the First ItaloEthiopian War at the end of the 19th century. Its vivid yellow color, currently derived from Tartrazine (a lemon-yellow azo dye), symbolized the Gold Rushes of the 1890s. Galliano is 60 proof (30% by volume). Among its approximately 30 herbal ingredients are star anise, Mediterranean anise, ginger, and citrus and vanilla. Galliano has a similar appearance to Strega (liqueur), another Italian herbal liqueur. Galliano is sweet and has a complex, vanilla-anise flavor with subtle citrus and woodsy herbal under notes. ",

Really nice sweetness, similar to cotton candy, comes through as you dig more into the aroma.”\r\n\r\nFlavor: “Melon and mango dominate up front, then chewy and juicy with a strong orange and pineapple presence. Finishes with a softness typical of the style. Hops are complex but there’s slightly too much bitterness to let the rest of the ingredients shine through. Medium-intense fruit flavors from hops and esters.”\r\n\r\nOverall: “Fun recipe. The aroma is spot on with this tropical and melon aroma that is really inviting. That carries through in the flavor, but the hops bitterness slightly overpowers the complexities offered in the aroma and upfront flavor. Enjoyable. I would order another pint.”",

In addition to the nuts and raisined-depth, there is a haunting toffee-sweetness on the palate of this dry wine. The finish persists for an age.",

Savvy sippers know to look for bottlings from estates such as Domaine Fournier, whose vineyard holdings in all three prime Sauvignon areas allow them to bottle juicy bargains like these under the Vin de Pays du Jardin appellation. This clean, citrusy mouthful is the perfect aperitif or picnic companion, ideal for savoring with fresh goat cheeses and tangy salads.",

To discourage this action, Melchor spread the rumor that his deepest, darkest cellar was the Calillero del Diablo (Cellar of the Devil), so that no one would dare go in there. It worked, and a legend was born. Today this mysterious and legendary cellar continues to hold the finest wines of Calillero del Diablo.\r\n\r\nTasting Notes:  Wine with good structure, an excellent balance, fresh and lively acidity. Medium bodied with a long and dry finish that ends with green pear and hints of white peach, complemented with a toasty overtone.\r\n\r\nFood Pairing: Enjoy this with delicate fish such as grilled sea bass, sole or turbot, garnished with capers or herb cream sauces.",

This way we personally select what goes into our beers.\r\nLook, legit pilz should have an aroma that leaps from the glass, and the bright, floral aroma of THE CRISP absolutely blasts your nostrils.

The nose is fruity and floral, yet it also comes off as warm and spicy. The taste is a delightful treat: heavy wheat mixed with banana, coriander, hay, honey, lemon zest, and pepper. The finish is rather dry, but it keeps that flavorful mouthfeel right to the mellow, creamy end. \r\n\r\nSome newcomers to the witbier approach may be shocked at the cloudiness of this beer, but the suspended yeast means that this beer is true to its parent style. Compared to most Belgians, Allagash White has a low alcohol percentage. Serve in a chilled tulip-style glass.",

Sam ’76 will surprise any craf\u001e beer lover with its huge flavor and aroma along with a light-bodied, refreshing crispness. At just 4.7% ABV, this brew is perfect for those sessionable occasions. Cascade, Citra, Mosaic, Simcoe and Galaxy hops impart a tropical citrus aroma that gives way to a bright, juicy citrus hop flavor but without the hop bitterness. The brewers have been experimenting for over a year, tested over 60 iterations with multiple combinations of 12 di\u001derent hop varieties in the nano brewery in Boston in order to perfect the Sam ’76 recipe.",

Consequently, the precious drink partially froze during transportation. Unaware that the brew was concentrated by the separation of water from the liquid. People were baffled by this unique version of Aventinus. By chance, the first Aventinus Eisbock was created. \r\nWell aware of this story, Hans Peter Drexler, brewmaster of the Schneider brewery, decided to recreate this classic \"mistake\" in a modern controlled facility. Thus, the Aventinus Eisbock is reborn sixty years later ... Prost!",

Unlike some other Oktoberfest-style beers, which are often very focused on doughy/bready malts, this brew offers a much more balanced approach, and actually leans a bit more towards the hoppy end of the spectrum. The malt presence is there on the nose, offering a bit of a bready, crackery quality, but we found the European noble hops really shine through, presenting a grassy, herbal, and lightly earthy quality bolstered with some notes of lemon pith. Expect a well-balanced beer on the palate, with a fairly substantial core of pils malt offering a touch of honey-like sweetness, while the hops balance with a lemony zing and a spicy herbal character that does a good job of drying out this festbier in the finish. Like all of the Weihenste",

Its alcohol content of 6 % volume makes it somewhat stronger than the usual lager. The original gravity of the Oktoberfest Beer is also slightly higher, starting at 13.5 %. With a hint of malty sweetness their Oktoberfest Beer possesses the perfect balance.\r\nCrystal-clear and brilliantly gold, the Paulaner Oktoberfestbier has been an institution since 1818. Perfectly balanced between subtle hops and bready malts, it has a zingy dry finish that is perfectly refreshing. This is one you could have over and over again--which is the point!\r\n\r\nThe Paulaner brewery has been in existence since 1634 when the friars of the order of Saint Francis of Paola had started brewing beer for their own use.\r\n\r\n6% ABV",

This small-batch gin is produced by William Grant \u0026 Sons and infused with cucumber, rose and traditional juniper at the brand\u0027s Scottish distillery. Small batches are typically defined as 1,000 liters or fewer, but Hendrick\u0027s Gin is crafted in tiny 500-liter batches, giving the master distiller more control over her artistry.\r\n\r\nWilliam Grant \u0026 Sons suggests serving the gin over ice with tonic water. Garnish with a cucumber slice instead of the traditional lemon wedge. Another great option is to serve the gin with soda water and a bit of elderflower.",

      "Description": "In the late 1800’s Brooklyn was one of the largest brewing centers in the country, home to more than 45 breweries. Lager beer in the “Vienna” style was one of the local favorites. Brooklyn Lager is amber-gold in color and displays a firm malt center supported by a refreshing bitterness and floral hop aroma. Caramel malts show in the finish. The aromatic qualities of the beer are enhanced by “dry-hopping”, the centuries-old practice of steeping the beer with fresh hops as it undergoes a long, cold maturation. The result is a wonderfully flavorful beer, smooth, refreshing and very versatile with food. Dry-hopping is largely a British technique, which is here used in a Viennese-style beer to create an American original.",

Thirty percent is aged in oak vats prior to bottling.\r\n\r\nBest with pizza, and pasta with tomato- or meat-based sauces.",
